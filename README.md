# DocumentAnalyst-by-DoctorTruth

## Hi, This your local DocumentAnalyst, DoctorTruth. 
#### What I do?
I make sure to eat any documents you feed me, just make sure to launch virtual environment
and run the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
by doing this you won't have a hazzle with your libraries and dependencies
and then create a local directory data and insert your files inside, for now Dr. Truth can only process PDF format
```
mkdir data
```
and then run
```
python pdf-rag.py
```
Now ask me any questions you have, I will give you my answer to utmost truth (atleast according to the documents you feed me)
